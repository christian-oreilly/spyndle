# Computation of the 2D cross-corellation of S-Transform spectra as described 
# in [1].
#
# Parameters:
#    readerClass    : Class of EEG reader. As of now, only HarmonieReader has 
#                     been implementer to be able to read .SIG file generated
#                     from the Harmonie software. To use this software, users 
#                     will most probably have to implement their own reader for 
#                     EEG file format they are using folowwing the example given 
#                     by the HarmonieReader class. If help is needed, contact
#                     the author (christian.oreilly@umontreal.ca). 
#    fileName       : File name of the EEG data.
#    resPath        : Repertory where the results will be saved.
#    eventName      : Name used to label the "spindle" events.
#    channelLst     : List of the recorded channels.
#    delta          : delta_w in [1]. The observation windows will be 
#                     slid from -delta to +delta. See [1]. (in seconds)
#                     Default value: 0.5

#                     Default value: 0.5
#    offset         : Should be 0.0 for computing the delays. A value of 5.0
#                     (in seconds)  can be used to compute false positive
#                     propagation. See [1].

#    eventProperties: List of string indicating the event properties that are
